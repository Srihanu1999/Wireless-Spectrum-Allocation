#  Wireless Spectrum Allocation and Interference Analysis

##  Overview
This project simulates dynamic wireless spectrum allocation using MATLAB. It implements cognitive radio, adaptive power control, and OFDM-based transmission for efficient spectrum management. The simulation detects idle spectrum slots and assigns them dynamically to secondary users, ensuring efficient frequency utilization

##  Features
-  **Adaptive Power Control** – Adjusts user transmission power based on interference levels.  
-  **Cognitive Radio Simulation** – Detects and utilizes free spectrum slots without interfering with primary users. 
-  **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** Analysis – Visualizes spectrum usage in a graphical format.
