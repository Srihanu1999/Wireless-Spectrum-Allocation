#  Wireless Spectrum Allocation and Interference Analysis

##  Overview
This project simulates **wireless spectrum allocation** in a multi-user environment and analyzes **interference levels** among users. It generates a **Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot** to visualize how multiple wireless signals interact in a shared frequency spectrum. This is useful for **5G, Wi-Fi, and cognitive radio systems**, where spectrum management is crucial.

##  Features
-  Simulates **multiple users** transmitting on different frequency bands  
-  Visualizes **spectrum usage** using a **Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot**  
-  Analyzes **interference effects** when signals overlap  
-  Demonstrates **real-world wireless spectrum allocation issues**
